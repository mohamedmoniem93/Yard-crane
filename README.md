2 Urgently needed modifications:

1st modification
----------------
I want the output to display total y(i,j) for all x(i,j,t) in the output


2nd modification
-----------------
I want to run the model for shift 1  (t = 1)
then update b(it) values by this equation : bi(t+1)= bit - xijt + xjit
Then run the model again using the new values at t=2
